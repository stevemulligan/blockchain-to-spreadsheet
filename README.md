WHAT: 
This is a Chrome browser extension that can help readers contextualize news stories with hype about crypto technology, this should make white papers and media stories about crypto more accurate. There is a 0.000001% chance this will be wrong.

WHY:
For fun.

HOW:
This is a fork of https://github.com/cynthiablee/blockchain-to-spreadsheet to express my cynical point of view.  Please see the original for installation instructions.

Special thanks:

Twitter user @mims (Christopher Mims) for [the suggestion](https://twitter.com/mims/status/968967786130300928) to make a "browser extension that replaces "blockchain" with "multiple copies of a giant Excel spreadsheet." For example, "multiple copies of a giant excel spreadsheet to revolutionize journalism." 

Thanks to Tom Maxwell for the [tutorial and template code](https://9to5google.com/2015/06/14/how-to-make-a-chrome-extensions/) for this project! 

Enjoy!
